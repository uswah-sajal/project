            The Blue Mosque, also known as the Sultan Ahmed Mosque, is one of
            Istanbul's most iconic landmarks and a must-visit destination for
            tourists. It was built in the early 17th century during the reign of
            Sultan Ahmed I and is named after its stunning blue tiles that adorn
            the interior walls. The mosque's six minarets and central dome
            dominate the skyline of Istanbul's old city and make it a
            recognizable symbol of the city.<br />
            <br>
            The mosque's interior is breathtaking, with its spacious prayer hall
            and soaring domes. It is designed in the classic Ottoman style, with
            intricate calligraphy and floral designs adorning the walls and
            ceilings. The stained-glass windows and chandeliers add to the
            mosque's beauty and create a serene and peaceful atmosphere.
            <br />The Blue Mosque is still an active place of worship and is
            open to visitors outside of prayer times. Visitors are required to
            dress modestly and remove their shoes before entering the mosque. It
            is also recommended to visit the mosque during non-prayer times to
            fully appreciate its beauty and avoid the crowds. Overall, the Blue
            Mosque is a must-visit destination for anyone traveling to Istanbul
            and offers a glimpse into the city's rich history and culture..
